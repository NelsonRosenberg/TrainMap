# TrainMap

Here is my implementation of the TrainMap problem.

I decided to use Spring Boot and Lombok to make the whole fundation easier and quicker to write, while still providing a robust framework.

The data comes from a txt file inside the resources folder and the DAO could be changed to load from any desired place, be it a DB, another file, or even the props file.

The controller was left as slim as possible since no UI implementation was required. It could be easily converted to a REST API or any other type of View.

The required tests are done with Junit, printing the answers before testing them just to make it more visual.

Since it also uses Maven, it should easily run in any IDE.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks a lot!
